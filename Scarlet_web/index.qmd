I am a Bachelor of Science (Honours) student at the University of Toronto, majoring in Physiology with a minor in Statistics. With a passion for both the biological sciences and data analysis, I am eager to bridge these fields through my work.

## 👀 Interests

I'm deeply interested in integrating my education in physiology with my technical skills in data analysis. I am committed to contributing to interdisciplinary studies and public health. My journey has taken me through various labs and research projects, from investigating liver ischemic injury at Unity Health to developing software for diabetes prevention with the PREVENT Project. These experiences have not only honed my lab and analytical skills but also fueled my passion for merging biological insights with data-driven solutions.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

I’m currently diving into advanced analysis methods, exploring how these can be applied to solve complex health challenges through innovative data analysis and technology applications.

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate

I'm eager to collaborate on projects aiming to tackle health challenges through innovative data analysis and technology applications. Whether it's developing predictive models for disease prevention or leveraging AI to better understand biological processes, I'm here to make a difference.

## 📫 How to Reach Me

Feel free to connect with me through email at [scarletruoxianwu@gmail.com](mailto:scarletruoxianwu@gmail.com). I'm always open to discussing new ideas, potential collaborations, or simply connecting with like-minded individuals in the field.
